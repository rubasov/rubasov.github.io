This is my personal blog.
My name is *Bence Romsics* in the English name order.
The original Hungarian order is Romsics Bence.
At a few places I also use the nick *rubasov*.
I speak English, Hungarian and a bit of Chinese.
I reside in Budapest, Hungary
([time zone UTC+1 or +2 in the summer][cet-cest])
and in my day job I'm a software developer.
Nowadays I mostly hack on [OpenStack][openstack].

In my free time I love to learn about a zillion things,
and this blog is mostly dedicated to my free-ranging curiosity.
